This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn. The project demonstrates dimensionality reduction by transforming 30 features into 2D for visualization, standardizing the data, and analyzing the cumulative explained variance to determine the number of components needed for 95% variance retention.
